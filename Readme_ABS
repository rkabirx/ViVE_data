Programs to run:

Togther:

ABS_Call.py


To observe each process seperately

Run: the receiver sockets calling:
1) CANBus_2Nov22.py
2) ABS_process.py
3) Hydraulic_modulator.py
4) Gateway.py


the sender sockets calling:
4) ABS_clients.py



press Brake_pedal GUI button to apply brake to activate ABS (default OFF).
For optimization, press auto random button.
Hydraulic_modulator will generate a GUI output for each value of the cycle to indicate ABS activation

If oserror occurs, type "sudo pkill python" in terminal and run again


Rafiul's flow in code-
        WheelSpeed_sensor ->
                              		 		  -> Hydraulic_modulator
              Brake_pedal ->                    ->  ABS_process
                             ADAS -> CANBus ->	         -> CANBus -> Gateway 



ADAS -- Provide Vehicle speed
CanBus -- Pass vehicle speed to ABS_process.py
ABS_process -- Calculate slip rate and pressure change and send it to Hydraulic Modulator
Hydraulic Modulator -- Receives updated pressure from ABS
